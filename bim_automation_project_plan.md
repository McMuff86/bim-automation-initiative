# BIM Automation Project Plan

> Dedicated workspace to build a BIM/CAD automation business with GPT‑5 as partner.

---

## 1) Project Setup
- **Project Name:** BIM Automation Initiative
- **Founder:** Adi Muff
- **AI Partner:** GPT‑5
- **Start Date:** 27.08.2025

### Objectives
- Automate repetitive BIM/CAD tasks (2D + 3D).  
- Build products/services for SMEs in metal/wood/door industries.  
- Establish a profitable, scalable business model.  

---

## 2) Phases & Milestones

### Phase 1 (0–6 months): Pilot & Foundation
- [ ] Select 1–2 pilot projects (e.g., door/frame analyzer, BOM export).  
- [ ] Build working prototypes (Python/Rhino/Grasshopper).  
- [ ] Run first client demo / internal showcase.  
- [ ] Collect feedback & measure time savings.  
- [ ] Publish first GitHub repo + website landing page.  

### Phase 2 (6–12 months): Positioning & Market Entry
- [ ] Define core offering: “BIM2Production Automation for SMEs”.  
- [ ] Package demo as Rhino/Grasshopper plugin or Revit add-in.  
- [ ] Create case studies with proven ROI.  
- [ ] First paying clients / consulting packages.  
- [ ] Marketing: website, LinkedIn, presentations.  

### Phase 3 (12–24 months): Scaling
- [ ] Turn prototypes into reusable plugins/libraries.  
- [ ] Develop ERP connectors (BORM, SAP).  
- [ ] Build partnerships with ERP/CAD vendors.  
- [ ] Offer training/consulting services.  
- [ ] Expand to international clients.  

---

## 3) To‑Do List (Immediate)
- [ ] Confirm pilot project focus.  
- [ ] Set up version control (GitHub/Bitbucket).  
- [ ] Create test dataset (DWG/DXF/IFC files).  
- [ ] Define JSON schema for 3D analysis and 2D.  
- [ ] Draft outreach list (potential SMEs to contact).

## 4) Roles & Responsibilities
- **Founder:** provide domain expertise, client contacts, validation, decision-making.  
- **AI (GPT‑5):** coding assistance, planning, documentation, market research, strategy.  
- **Future Partners:** (optional) UI/UX dev, sales partner, integration engineer.  

---

## 5) Success Metrics
- **Technical:** prototypes working in Rhino/Revit/IFC.  
- **Business:** first paying client by Phase 2.  
- **Scalability:** at least 1 plugin/library used by multiple clients by Phase 3.  

---

## 6) Next Steps
1. Start a dedicated project chat (this workspace).  
2. Confirm pilot project scope.  
3. Break down technical tasks into sprints (2–3 weeks).  
4. Begin development with unit tests + gold samples.  
5. Document progress in `BIM_Automation_Business_Roadmap` and update regularly.
